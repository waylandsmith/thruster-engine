NOTE:  thruster-engine has been renamed Boiler.

TO DOWNLOAD: in the base directory is a tarball called boiler_code.  This contains the most recent 'stable' code.
Boiler is still under development, so 'stable' is a relative term; but it's more likely to be working than the mess
in test-pages.  Click on this tarball, and then click 'Raw' to download and open.
